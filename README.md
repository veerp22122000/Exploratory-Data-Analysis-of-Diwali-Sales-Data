Diwali sales data is obtained from local storage.<br/>
The data is cleaned and preprocessed by removing null rows and irrelevant columns to ensure accurate analysis.<br/>
The cleaned data is then used for graphical analysis using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn to explore the relationship between sales and factors like gender, age, state, marital status, occupation, and product category.<br/>
These visualizations help in identifying key influences on sales trends and patterns across different demographics and product categories.<br/>
